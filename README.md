# openapi-tools

This is a fork of
[openapi-schema-diff](https://github.com/fastify/openapi-schema-diff) by
[Ivan Tymoshenko](https://github.com/ivan-tymoshenko) of
[Fastify](https://github.com/fastify). It has been modified to be typescript
first, adds a Zod schema for the API spec, and uses [Deno](https://deno.land)
for development instead of Node.

Note that this was designed for use at
[Oxide Computer Company](https://oxide.computer) which currently uses OpenAPI
version 3.0.3 for their schema. As such, the types and schema validation are
designed for that version of the OpenAPI spec.

**openapi-tools** is a TypeScript library that provides utilities like semantic
schema diffing, changelog generation, version compatability checks, and more.
